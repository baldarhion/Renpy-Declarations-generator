I'm a lazy programmer, and I figured that writing all this stuff for declarations was not for me (Shells-scripts lovers will understand :p).

So, here is the how-to. I assume that all your sprites are in a subdirectory of /game/ and you have one folder for each character (and of course the name of the directory is the name of the character). Your BG are in a directory.

To sum up, here's the recommended directories structure:


/game/
       |_______/Characters/
       |                  |_________/Kiko/
       |                  |           |______________/kiko_uniform_angry.png
       |                  |           |______________/kiko_casual_angry.png
       |                  |
       |                  |_________/Sigmund/
       |                              |______________/sigmund_feud.png
       |                              |______________/sigmund_uniform_hungry.png
       |
       |
       |________/BG/
       |          |______________/messy_kitchen.jpg
       |          |______________/messy-graveyard.jpg
       |
       |__renpy_init_script.py


So... The script will build a file named "_renpy.py".

In this file you'll have all the declarations done. The script will build character tags (ex: "kik" for Kiko, "sig" for Sigmund, etc...)

This script is fully commented so you can customize it easily.(I can help you if you wish... Don't be shy !)

Well, hope it will be useful.

Don't forget to modify the variables to fit your project.
