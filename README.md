Renpy-Declarations-generator
============================

A little Python script to generate all declarations for a Ren'py VN


Use:

Just execute the script in the directory /games/ of your VN, the script will generate all needed declarations for BG/Sprites/Characters.

By default, the script will parse a ./Character/ directory. In this directory, you should make a directory per character. The script will use name of the file to do sprites declaration and create three caracter name for them.

Same thing for the backgrounds (./Background directory).

Of course if you have another tree structure you can modify the path_to_character and path_to_BG variables.

Feel free to comment, improve.

In the future, I plan to add a simple UI in TK to ease the process.
